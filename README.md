<b> Team 3 - Defenders of the Keystore</b>

<b>Problem:</b>  Using vSphere's VM Encryption functionality requires an external KMS setup and configuration for an administrator to get started using this feature.  If you're a vSphere admin and know very little about KMS, this may prove a difficult task.  

<b>Hackathon Goal:</b>  Encrypt two VMs using Hytrust as the KMS.  This involves deploying a two-node Hytrust cluster, registering and configuring the KMS nodes with vCenter, creating VMs to encrypt, and actually turning on encryption for the VMs in question.
